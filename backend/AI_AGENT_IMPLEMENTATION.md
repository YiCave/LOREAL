    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.1)
        self.knowledge_base = self.load_dashboard_knowledge()
        
    def explain_metric(self, metric_name, current_value):
        """Explain what a specific metric means"""
        
    def interpret_chart(self, chart_data, chart_type):
        """Interpret chart data and explain trends"""
        
    def guide_user(self, user_goal):
        """Provide step-by-step guidance for dashboard usage"""

### 10. Example Usage Scenarios

#### Business Insights
```
User: "What trends do you see in our comment analysis?"
AI: "Based on your dashboard data, I notice a 15% increase in engagement for hair-related content. I recommend focusing on hair styling tutorials and considering partnerships with hair care brands..."

User: "How can we improve our content strategy?"
AI: "Looking at your topic leaderboard, 'Makeup Tutorials' has the highest engagement. I suggest creating more beginner-friendly makeup content and leveraging the trending hashtags..."
```

#### Dashboard Explanations
```
User: "What does the coherence score mean?"
AI: "The coherence score measures how well-defined and interpretable your topics are. A score of 0.531 for 26 topics indicates good topic quality. Higher scores mean topics are more distinct and meaningful..."

User: "Why is Topic 20 performing so well?"
AI: "Topic 20 (Hair Care & Styling) shows strong performance with 8,076 videos and 23.1% of total content. This suggests high audience interest in hair-related content..."
```
